device_monitor
==============

A program for adding hypothetical state machines to an environment and monitoring their pseudorandomly changing states. 
This program was created as an "assignment" for the second half of my interview for a programming position within
Instructional Media Services at Wesleyan University. It is designed to run in a UNIX terminal. There are some hackish
solutions and inconsistencies, as well as a bit of code reuse that I could have cut down upon, but I'm pretty pleased with
how it came out overall.

Some voodoo has been going on with the files, random corruptions and whatnot. I'm also currently getting a
NullPointerException when running this in the IDE console, which may have something to do with my last-minute audible
to generally use console() for user input rather than a Scanner, or perhaps an ASCII escape sequence I implemented to
tidy up the terminal display. I'm not married to this project, but I definitely have some tidy-up to do when I revisit
the code.
